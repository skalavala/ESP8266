# Welcome to @Vasiley's Home Automation Repository.

I currently have two instances of Home Assistant running:

1. Running on a Raspberry Pi, dedicated to my [Fish Tank](https://github.com/Vasiley/Home-Assistant_FishTank), where it automatically monitors and maintain Lighting, Temperature, Water levels, and alerts me in case of any abnormalities. You can gind my [Fish Tank Repository Here](https://github.com/Vasiley/Home-Assistant_FishTank)
