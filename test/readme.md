# Welcome to @Vasiley's Home Automation World

I currently have two instances of [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io) running:

1. Running on a Raspberry Pi 3, dedicated to my [Fish Tank](https://github.com/Vasiley/Home-Assistant_FishTank), where it automatically monitors and maintain Lighting, Temperature, Water levels and alerts me whenever it requires my attention.
